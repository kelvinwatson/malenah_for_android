GEOCODING: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro

When users provide an address to be placed into database, use Geocoding to convert address to a double lat and double lng and store in database.


Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into  geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map. Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address. The Google Maps Geocoding API's reverse geocoding service also lets you find the address for a given place ID. The Google Maps Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request.
